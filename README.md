# Operations_Research_TSPTravelingSalesProblem

In this assignment I will design an algorithm to solve a fundamental problem faced by every
traveling salesperson, aptly named The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). All traveling salespeople start from their home, travel to several cities to sell their goods, and complete the day by
returning home. 

To minimize their costs, traveling salespeople strive to visit all of the cities using
the shortest total travel distance. This amounts to finding a visitation order of all of the cities that
minimizes the sum of distances traveled when moving from one city to another.
